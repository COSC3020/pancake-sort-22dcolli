# Pancake Sort

There is an abstract data type (ADT) called a *pancake array*, which provides
the function `flip(array, n)`, which takes the top (first) $n$ items in the
array and "flips them over", i.e. reverses their order.

For example, if you called `flip([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)`, the result would
be the array  `[2, 1, 3, 4]`, because the order of the (first) top 2
elements in the array has been reversed.

If $n$ is larger than the number of items in the array, the entire array gets
reversed. The intuition for the name "pancake array" is that with a stack of
pancakes, you can insert a spatula at any point in the stack and use it to flip
over all pancakes above that point.

Implement a sorting function that will sort an array of pancakes such that the
smallest pancake is at the top. You may use only the `flip()` function to
manipulate the array. You may break ties arbitrarily. Test your new function;
I've provided some basic testing code that uses
[jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in `code.test.js`, but it only tests
`pancakeSort()`, not `flip()`.

Hint: Start by thinking about the calls to `flip()` required to move a *single*
element into its correct position.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the asymptotic runtime ($\Theta$) of your algorithm in terms of the
number of comparisons? What is it in terms of the number of flips? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

Number of Comparisons: I believe that the runtime would be $\Theta(n^{2})$, because looking at the flip function which has fewer iterations in combination with my pancake function which calls flip twice and has 2 for loops.(Sort of "Hand Wavy" in my analysis here because I'm a little unsure if I'm correct)

Number of Flips: For any given item the most flips possible is 2, one to get the item into the first position and another to put it in last position. Not every item in the array will need to be flipped of course, but I think overall the 2 flips indicates $\Theta(2n)$, but because we drop constants I think the final result would just be $\Theta(n)$
